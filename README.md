# go-signature-adaptor

[WIP] Pure Go implementation of signature adaptors using ECDSA. Currently implemented for secp256k1 but generalized to be extended over any curve. It is based off the [DLC spec](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/ECDSA-adaptor.md).

## Requirements

go 1.17+

libgmp: `sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev`
